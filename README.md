# Eros Rootkit:

Author : [RagingGrim](https://github.com/RagingGrim)

The Eros Rootkit is a special kind of malware with it's own custom bootloader. The rootkit takes control of the system before forking and passing control to the operating system. ( Sort of).

Due to recent events in my personal life I have more ( but less ) time to spend on this project. I am going to take it into a slightly different direction, for now the repository will be about building smaller parts of a rootkit with the intent of at the very end having a feasible framework to build on.
